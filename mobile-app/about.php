    <h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: dinbold;">Did you know that 80% of all in-demand middle-skill jobs call for digital skills?</h3>
    <h4 style="text-align: center; font-family: dinbold;">By 2020, the amount of Potential 1M unfilled jobs will climb.</h4>
<img src="images/numbers.png" width="80%" height="80%" class="numbers" alt="codeRVA numbers" />
<h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: dinbold;">Now, there is CodeRVA, a hybrid high school to solve this problem.</h3>
  <p class="coderva-about-p">We are the Richmond Regional School for Innovation (CodeRVA), and our main goal is to increase the number of computer science professionals in the region before being replicated across all 16 tech career clusters. Our mission is to create a school in which underserved, low-income or marginalized students will have equal access to college and career preparation in a unique, highly-engaging and relevant enviornment. CodeRVA is accepting 82 applicants the first year and plans to expand to over 800 students within the next 8 years.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: dinbold;">What We Provide</h3>
          <p class="coderva-about-p">During the first two years of high school, students will complete a majority of the courses required for a high school diploma through facilitated online coursework. Virtual learning will be provided by collab projects and face-to-face interactions with teachers and industry experts. During the last two years of high school, partnerships with community colleges and employers will allow students to participate in paid work experience, and to graduate high school with an associate’s degree, industry certifications, and guaranteed employment.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: dinbold;">What CodeRVA Students Receive</h3>
          <p class="coderva-about-p">CodeRVA students will graduate with a high school diploma and over 400 hours of paid information technology work experience, with no academic prerequisites.</p></td>
        <h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: dinbold;">Why It Was Created and What Is It </h3>
          <p class="coderva-about-p">As new generations of students are becoming interest in all the newest technology; schools need to get with the times with all the education with the newest technologies. We hope that students will be able to jump into the code of technology program and have no problems with this process.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: dinbold;">Why is this Innovative?</h3>
        <p class="coderva-about-p">Your child will complete all high school credits during their 9th and 10th grade year. All of their courses will be personalized/blended learning experiences and/or full-time virtual learning. Also, all courses will be built on integration of subject matter and instruction will be project-based. Our main innovation is that all of your child's courses will be integrated with a Computer Science component and the school will be 1 to 1 with technology.</p>
          
  <h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: dinbold;">The Application Process</h3>
  <p class="coderva-about-p">All students in the 8th grade are encouraged to apply. There are no admission criteria or academic prerequisites. This new regional school will be designed to serve a diverse, lottery-selected student population and will embody design principles of personalization, adult world connections, and career.</p>
